Pure Java Library to generate Windows WMF files

See http://forum.plantuml.net/7989/windows-metafile-wmf-emf-export-is-really-wanted

This is a try to generate Windows WMF files from pure Java code.
Files have been generated using https://www.tangiblesoftwaresolutions.com/product_details/csharp_to_java_converter_details.html on https://github.com/papnkukn/wmf

This does not compile yet, so any help is welcome.

Once we will have something working, this will be integrated into main PlantUML Library.

Missing stuff:

* BinaryReader / BinaryWriter
* TODO TASK: There is no preprocessor in Java
